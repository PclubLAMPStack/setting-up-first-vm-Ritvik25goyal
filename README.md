# Installation of VMware
### I downloaded VMware Pro from its official site and installed it using the license key from [the github repo.](https://gist.github.com/PurpleVibe32/1e9b30754ff18d69ad48155ed29d83de)
# Installation of CentOS iso
### I downloaded the iso file from the link given by the mentor on a discord .Then i installed that iso file to create a VM in VMware with usual configuration of processor , ram and storage.
### I googled to how to install centos without GUI then i found this command and for that you should be in root account
```shell
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```
### which switchoff the GUI and after restarting the VM it was coming no GUI so I think the task is done.
